### ANGAZA ADAPTIVE LEARNING MODEL

The aim of this system is to optimize content to adjust for the learner's goals and current state of knowledge.

The system decides which content to show the learner based on the trained data from the Angaza Elimu DB. And determines what learning path that a student should be put on based on the Item Response theory.
